<!-- NOTE: This exercise illustrates and reinforces your understanding of the browser rendering process as well as provides practice in HTML and CSS topics. Follow the steps to understand how each part of your HTML and CSS contributes to what you see in the browser. -->

<!-- Deliverable: A static website that is rendered in a local browser (or on the WWW) that matches all of the tasks, including an AI-generated or other creative commons image and external CSS. -->

<!-- Make a topic of your choice or one of the suggested topics below, and use it for the title, heading/s, and topic of your content below! You could also start a portfolio page/personal branding site if you don't have one already. -->

<!-- You're welcome to style and add to the page as you please as long as you satisfy the shown task requests exactly (the MVP, or Minimal Viable Product). Make sure this MVP is met before adding/styling more. -->

<!-- Make sure you use AI tools/internet search/documentation as discussed in previous classes, as needed. -->

<!-- Step 1: Creating the DOM - The browser starts rendering by constructing the DOM from your HTML. -->

<!-- Task: Specify the HTML document type for modern web pages (Add your declaration below this line). -->


<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title> <!-- Add your topic here --> </title>
    
    <!-- Step 2: Creating the CSSOM - Linking and applying styles influence how elements are displayed. -->
    
    <!-- Task: Link to an external CSS file named 'style.css'. -->
    
  <!-- Add your link element here -->

    <style>
       
      /* Embedded styles (with the <style> tags also influence the CSSOM. Let's practice modifying it. */
      

        /* Task: Set the background color of the page to a light shade. */
      
        body {
        
        /* Step 5: Painting - The browser fills in pixels, drawing out text, colors, and images. */

            /* Task: Replace 'your-color' with a real color value */

            /* NOTE: Make sure that your background and font colors contrast well for high accessibility, using tools and principles discussed in class. */

            background-color: your-color;
        }

        /* Step 3: Constructing the Render Tree - The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to form the Render Tree. */
      
            /* Task: Ensure your CSS is structured to reflect visible elements only. Think about how each rule contributes to rendering. */

        
        h1 {
        
        /* Step 4: Layout Calculation (Reflow) - The browser calculates each element's size and position. */

          /* Task: Align your heading to the center, which will be considered during the layout phase. */

            text-align: correct-value;
        }

        
        p {
          
          /* Set a font size and color to contribute to what gets painted on the screen. You may opt to make font*/
          
          /* Step 4: Layout Calculation (Reflow) - The browser calculates each element's size and position. */
          
          font-size: your-size;

        }

    </style>

    <!-- Task: Change the use of embedded CSS to using the external stylesheet you've indicated in the <link> tag. (HINT: You'll be removing the <style> tags and filling in the CSS pane to the right). Note that this involves Step 2: Creating the CSSOM; you're still influencing the CSSOM's creation, just through a different approach.  -->

  </head>
<body>

    <!-- Creating content in your body contributes to Step 1: Creating the DOM. -->
    
    <!-- Task: Add a main heading to your page using the 'h1' tag. Make it your topic or something related to it. -->
    
    <!-- Task: Below the heading, add a paragraph introducing your topic/your take on it. Use the 'p' tag. -->
    
    <!-- Task: Insert an image that complements your topic using the 'img' tag. You must use one attribute for the source of the image and one that's best practice for accessibility, then provide appropriate values for them. -->

    <!-- Task: Create an unordered list without bullets that shares interesting facts or other related elements about your chosen topic.-->
